To display just the time use the following:

date +%T
Alternatively, use the following:

date +%H:%M:%S
Attach the date, as well, using the command:

date +%d/%m/%Y%t%H:%M:%S
Alternatively, use the follow (since %T is equivalent to %H:%M:%S):

date +$d/%m/%Y%t%T
The : and / characters are optional and can be whatever you want. For example:

date +%dc%mc%Y

outputs: 24c09c2020, if you wanted to use 'c' as a delimiter for some reason.

Use any combination of the above switches after the plus symbol to output the date as you so wish. If you want to add spaces you can use quotes around the date.

date +'%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S'
How to Show the UTC Date
View the UTC date for your computer using the following command:

date -u
If you are in the UK you will notice that instead of showing "18:58:20" as the time it will show "17:58:20" as the time.

How to Show the RFC Date
View the RFC date for your computer using the following command:

date --rfc-2822
This displays the date in the following format:

Wed, 20 Apr 2018 19:56:52 +0100
This flag is useful as it shows that you are an hour ahead of GMT.

Some Useful Date Commands
Do you want to know the date next Monday? Try this:

date -d "next Monday"

At the point of writing this returns "Mon 25 Apr 00:00:00 BST 2016"

The -d basically prints a date in the future or the past. So, you can use "next Monday" or "last Friday".

Using the same command you can find out which day of the week your birthday or Christmas falls upon.

date -d 12/25/2016

The result is Sun Dec 25.

Summary
It is worth checking out the manual page for the date command using the following command:

man date
