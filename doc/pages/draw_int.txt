:sig
u64 draw_int(u64 from, u64 to)

:params
from : minimum value
to : maximum value
return value : a noise value between 'from' and 'to'

:desc
This function works exactly like generate_int(), but context->random_index is used for the 'index' value and context->random_seed is used for the seed. After this function has been called, the context->random_index is increased by one. At the start of every request, context->random_seed is automatically populated with a new seed value.
